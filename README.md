# PhD Website Starter (Free)

This is a single-file, fancy personal website that you can host for **free** on GitHub Pages.

## Quick Start
1. Create a repository named `USERNAME.github.io` on GitHub (replace USERNAME with your GitHub username).
2. Upload the files in this folder (just drag-and-drop in the GitHub web UI).
3. Go to **Settings â†’ Pages**, set **Build from a branch**, choose `main` and `/ (root)`, and save.
4. Visit `https://USERNAME.github.io` after a minute. You should see your site live.

## Customize
Open `index.html` and replace:
- `YOUR NAME`, email, and links in the header & Contact section.
- `assets/avatar.jpg` with your own image (keep the same filename).
- `assets/CV.pdf` with your CV file.

Edit the Publications/Projects/Teaching sections as you like.
